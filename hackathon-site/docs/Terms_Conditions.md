### Project Options

Teams may choose **ONE** of the following approaches:

#### Option 1: Feature Requests (Provided by Organizers)
Work on pre-defined feature requests that address specific needs in the Ajrasakha system. These will be shared after registration.

#### Option 2: Propose Your Own Feature
Teams can propose and implement their own innovative features that align with Ajrasakha's mission.

**Examples of potential features:**
- Voice-enabled interface with multilingual support
- Agricultural knowledge repository and Q&A system

- Government scheme eligibility checker with document parsing
- Soil health digitization and recommendation engine
- Predictive analytics for crop diseases or market trends
- Community forum with expert verification
- Offline-capable mobile-first design for rural areas

## Focus Areas & Requirements

### Technical Requirements

#### Mandatory Integration
- ✅ **Must integrate with existing Ajrasakha MERN stack**
- ✅ **Must be deployable within the existing system architecture**
- ✅ **Cannot be a standalone application**
- ⚠️ **Projects that cannot integrate will be considered failures**

#### Technology Stack
**Core (Required):**
- MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js

**Additional (Allowed):**
- Python for AI/ML components
- AI models (OpenAI, HuggingFace, custom models)
- Additional frameworks/libraries that integrate cleanly

**You may use:**
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) for offline capabilities
- Lightweight frameworks for low-end devices
- Image compression and lazy loading
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs
- Translation APIs (Google Translate, IndicTrans2)
- OCR services (Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, MongoDB Atlas)
- Maps APIs (Google Maps, Mapbox)

### Cost-Effectiveness Criteria ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**This is a PRIMARY evaluation criterion**

All solutions must be viable for **large-scale deployment in India**:

✅ **Do:**
- Minimize GPU usage and API costs
- Use cost-effective alternatives (open-source models, cached data)
- Prioritize expert-validated datasets over LLM calls
- Design for cheaper operation than human-operated systems
- Request GPU access from organizers (provided selectively based on merit)
- Bring your own datasets or request from organizers

❌ **Don't:**
- Use expensive API calls without justification
- Rely heavily on paid LLM services (GPT-4, Claude) without caching
- Design solutions requiring continuous GPU compute
- Ignore cost implications of your architecture

**Cost justification will be evaluated in both phases**

### Farmer-Centric Design Requirements

#### Accessibility
- Mobile-first design (most farmers use smartphones)
- Works on 2G/3G networks with low bandwidth
- Optimized for basic Android devices
- Large text, clear buttons, intuitive navigation
- At least **one regional language** support (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.)

#### User Experience
- Simple interface for users with limited digital literacy
- Voice input/output capabilities (highly encouraged)
- Offline functionality where applicable
- Visual aids (icons, illustrations, infographics)
- Fast load times (<3 seconds on 3G)

#### Content Quality
- Practical, actionable farming advice
- Expert-validated information
- Localized content for Indian agriculture
- Region-specific recommendations
