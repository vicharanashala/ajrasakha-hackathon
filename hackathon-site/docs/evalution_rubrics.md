### Phase 1 + Phase 2 Combined Evaluation

Projects will be evaluated holistically across both phases:

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Ajrasakha Integration** | 25% | How well does it integrate with the existing system? Is it deployable? Does it fit the architecture? |
| **Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability** | 20% | Is it viable for large-scale Indian deployment? GPU/API costs justified? Cheaper than human alternatives? |
| **Technical Implementation Quality** | 20% | Code quality, architecture, performance, security, mobile optimization, low-bandwidth handling |
| **Innovation & Impact Potential** | 15% | How creative is the solution? What problem does it solve? Potential farmer impact? |
| **Completeness & Functionality** | 10% | Does it work? Are features complete? Is it polished? |
| **Efficient Resource Usage** | 10% | Minimal GPU, API, computational costs? Smart use of caching, datasets? |

### Additional Evaluation Factors

#### Strong Positive Factors

-  Comprehensive documentation

#### Strong Negative Factors
-  Cannot integrate with Ajrasakha system
-  High API costs without justification
-  Requires expensive GPU for operation
-  Desktop-only, not mobile-optimized
-  Requires high bandwidth
-  English-only interface
-  Plagiarized code
-  Over-engineered solutions
